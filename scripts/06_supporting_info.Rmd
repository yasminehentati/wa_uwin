## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Raw data counts 
```{r}
wa_counts <- read_csv("data/wa_counts.csv")
head(wa_counts)

# sum all active trap nights 
sum(wa_counts$days.active, na.rm = TRUE)

# Table of all raw counts -- both 

all_counts <- wa_counts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count))

gt(all_counts) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Both cities")


# Table of raw counts -- by city 

# seattle 
sewa_counts <- wa_counts %>% 
group_by(species) %>% 
  filter(city == "sewa") %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count))

gt(sewa_counts) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Seattle")
  
# tacoma 
tawa_counts <- wa_counts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  filter(city == "tawa") %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count))
 
gt(tawa_counts) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Tacoma")


```
